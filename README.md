## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- JavaScript Functionalities
- CSS Flexbox

### What I learned

Working on this project, I learnt how to make toggle buttons, as well as the CSS 'transform:scale()' property. I also used more of Linear gradients in the slider and the 'learn more' buttons.


### Useful resources

- [Linear Gradients](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_gradients.asp) - This taught me how to move a linear gradient from thhe left to the right of an element.
- [Slider Toggle](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_switch.asp) - This taught me how to create my slider toggle, and add colors to it as well during and after each click.
